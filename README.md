## Structure

The repository is structured as follows:

- `.idea`: Contains project metadata.
- `gmaths`: Contains mathematical operations and classes necessary for rendering.
- `out/production/assignment`: Miscellaneous folder.
- `shaders`: Contains the shader files necessary for rendering.
- `textures`: Contains the texture files used in the scene.
- `Camera.java`: Java file for camera operations.
- `Cube.java`, `Desk.java`, `Egg.java`, `Hatch.java`, `Lamp1.java`, `Lamp2.java`, `Light.java`, `Mesh.java`, `Model.java`, `ModelNode.java`, `NameNode.java`, `SGNode.java`, `Shader.java`, `Skybox.java`, `Sphere.java`, `TextureLibrary.java`, `TransformNode.java`, `TwoTriangles.java`: These files contain the main classes and methods for rendering different objects and elements within the scene.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed (e.g., OpenGL).
3. Import the project into your favorite IDE.
4. Navigate to the `shaders` and `textures` folders and ensure they are correctly linked within your project settings.

## Usage

1. Run the `Main` class to launch the animated scene.
2. Use the controls specified in `Camera.java` to navigate through the scene.
3. Explore the different objects and textures by interacting with the environment.
