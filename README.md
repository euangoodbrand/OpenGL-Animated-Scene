## Structure
The repository is organized into several folders and Java files each serving a unique purpose in the rendering and animation of the scene:

- `.idea`: Project metadata.
- `gmaths`: Mathematical operations and classes for rendering.
- `out/production/assignment`: Miscellaneous folder.
- `shaders`: Shader files for rendering.
- `textures`: Texture files for scene objects.
- Various `.java` files: Containing classes and methods for rendering and animating different objects within the scene.

## Setup
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed (e.g., OpenGL).
3. Import the project into your preferred IDE.
4. Ensure the `shaders` and `textures` folders are correctly linked within your project settings.

## Usage
1. Run the `Hatch` class to launch the animated scene.
2. Utilize the controls specified in `Camera.java` to navigate through the scene.
3. Interact with the environment to explore the different objects and textures.

## Features

### Room and Window:
- The room consists of three walls and a floor, textured to resemble a meeting room setting.
- The back wall is a large window displaying an outdoor scene that changes over time.

### Anglepoise Lamps:
- Two uniquely designed anglepoise lamps, capable of adopting different poses to point their heads in various directions.
- Each lamp can articulate its joints and the lightbulb within the head functions as a spotlight illuminating the scene.

### Egg-like Object:
- An egg-like object placed on a table, with a texture displaying both matt and shiny parts, portraying an animated interaction as it occasionally jumps and rotates.

### User Interface and Controls:
- A user-controlled camera positioned within the scene for navigation.
- Interface options to control the lighting, the spotlight on the lamps, and to maneuver the lamps into different poses.

### Animation:
- Smooth animation between different lamp poses, enhancing the visual engagement of the scene.

## Scene Description
A playful interaction unfolds in a textured room where two creatively designed anglepoise lamps examine a peculiar egg-like object on a table. The room's large window reveals an outdoor scene that morphs subtly as time progresses. The lamps, capable of altering their poses, cast spotlight effects on the scene, adding a layer of whimsy and curiosity. This animated scene invites exploration and interaction, showcasing a lively advertorial setting for the novel range of anglepoise lamps.
